Soon to be a dashboard to serve as an interface between my Raspberry Pi, the lighting, air conditioning, and blinds in my room.

I want a way to control the utilities in my room over the web. These include Phillip Hue lightbulbs, Samsung SMART air conditioning unit, and a ethernet-connected motor to close and open the blinds. The ultimate goal is for this to be a "dashboard" with knobs/controls allowing me to interact with these devices via a closed network and various APIs.
